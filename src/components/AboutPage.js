                    <p>
                        The "Number Position" game is a simple yet challenging puzzle game where you have to guess a secret code consisting of four unique digits. You have to figure out the correct numbers and their positions by making guesses, with feedback given after each guess. The goal is to guess the secret code in the fewest attempts possible.

                    <h2>How the Game Works</h2>
                    <p>Two players compete against each other.</p>
                    <p>Each player has a secret code.</p>
                    <p>Players take turns guessing each other's secret code.</p>
                    <p>After each guess, feedback is provided on how many numbers are correct and how many are in the correct position.</p>
                    <p>The player who guesses the secret code first wins the game.</p>

                    <p>
                        I aim to build a strong community around this game where players can constantly challenge each other and improve their skills. With time, I hope to expand the game with additional features, new puzzles, and even more engaging modes. Stay tuned for future updates!
